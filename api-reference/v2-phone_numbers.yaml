    Lookup reputation or identity info about a raw phone number
  summary: Manual Phone Lookup V2
  operationId: v2LookupPhone
  parameters:
    - name: targetPhone
      in: query
      required: true
      description: |
        Unparsed raw phone number to be looked up. When possible a properly formatted e.164 phone number is preferred. Additionally, the country calling code can be separated from the rest of the phone number using a forward slash (/) to improve parsing of this field.
        If a country calling code is not included with the request, then the system will attempt to find the best match, but will default to US-based numbers in the event that a phone number returns multiple matches.
      example: "(425)830-3651"

        ISO 3166 Alpha 2 country code associated with the targetPhone. This is used as a parsing hint, especially in cases where the country code is not included in the targetPhone value.

        The mobile country codes (MCC) and mobile network code (MNC) of the originating carrier. This property uses a forward slash (/) delimiter. This is a parsing hint when the targetPhone value does not include a country code.
